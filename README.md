# Trading-Algorithms
This is a collection of trading algorithms that I coded for personal gain. 

- **BacktraderAlgorithm**: simple Backtrader test.
- **FearAndGreed**: implementation of the Fear and Greed strategy using Backtrader.
- **LSTM_to_Predict_Closing_Stock_Prices**: use Long Short Term Memory neural networks to predict the closing prices of a stock.
- **RSI**: computation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to determine if a stock is oversold or overbought.
- **Stock_Prices_Prediction_Using_SVR_and_LinearRegression**: use Support Vector Machine Regression and Linear Regression to predict closing stock prices. Support Vector Regression gives us the flexibility to define how much error is acceptable in our model and will find an appropriate line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to fit the data. Linear Regression fits a linear model with coefficients $w = (w_1, \dots, w_p)$ to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.
