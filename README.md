This is a collection of trading algorithms that I coded for personal gain. 

- **BacktraderAlgorithm**: simple Backtrader test.
- **FearAndGreed**: implementation of the Fear and Greed strategy using Backtrader.
- **LSTM_to_Predict_Closing_Stock_Prices**: use Long Short Term Memory neural networks to predict the closing prices of a stock.
- **RSI**: computation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to determine if a stock is oversold or overbought.
- **Stock_Prices_Prediction_Using_SVR_and_LinearRegression**: use Support Vector Machine Regression and Linear Regression to predict closing stock prices.
